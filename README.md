## Problem Statement
In countries with a hot climate, such as Tanzania, many schools experience classroom conditions characterized by extreme temperatures, which can severely impede the learning process and pose significant health risks to students. The primary challenge lies in the need for more detailed, actionable data regarding specific classroom features that influence indoor temperatures, such as roofing materials and the presence or absence of ceiling boards. Traditional methods for monitoring and improving these conditions often fall short because they need to provide the precise, localized information necessary for effective intervention.

## Impact of the Problem
1. **Ineffective Learning Environments:** High temperatures hinder student concentration and learning effectiveness.
2. **Health Risks:** Extreme temperatures can lead to heat-related illnesses among students and staff.
3. **Inadequate Resource Allocation:** Without accurate data, resources may be misallocated, failing to address the most critical needs.
4. **Barriers to Policy Implementation:** Insufficient data hampers policymakers' ability to implement effective strategies for improving classroom environments.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven predictive model using satellite imagery and environmental data to estimate indoor classroom temperatures in Tanzanian schools, enhancing learning environments and health safety. The model determines temperature conditions based on observable features like roofing material complemented with classroom specifications (including ceiling boards). 

## Approach
The project employs machine learning techniques and satellite imagery analysis to create predictive models for indoor temperatures, enabling schools to take proactive measures for improvement.

## Project Phases
The project unfolds over a **8+2-week cycle**, with the following phases planned to ensure successful development and deployment:
1. **Data Collection and Resources:** Gather relevant environmental data and satellite imagery.
2. **Problem Definition and Model Development:** Define the specific objectives and develop the predictive model.
3. **Temperature Range Detection:** Analyze and estimate indoor temperature ranges based on classroom features.
4. **Visualization and Reporting:** Create visual representations of data findings for better understanding and communication.
5. **Flood Risk Assessment:** Assess potential flooding risks about classroom conditions.
6. **Deliverables and Optimization:** Finalize deliverables and optimize the model for improved accuracy.

## Implementation
- Collaborate with educational institutions to gather data on classroom features and conditions.
- Utilize satellite imagery and environmental data to build the predictive model.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing temperature predictions and recommendations.

## Metrics for Success
- Temperature predictions are accurate compared to actual measurements.
- User engagement with the model and visualization tools.
- Feedback from educational stakeholders on the effectiveness of the interventions.

## Future Work
Further enhancements could include:
- Expanding the model to incorporate additional environmental factors affecting indoor temperatures.
- Integrating community feedback to refine the predictive model and its usability.
- Collaborating with local authorities to implement recommendations and monitor their impact.
